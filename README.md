# C++ Project - Car Rental System

The purpose of this project is to streamline how the car rental applications work.
The following app has 3 main options:
  1. Administrator option
  2. Company registration option
  3. Client option


#### Brief description:

The administrator part can view the list of companies registered. Addtionally, he can warn the companies if the reviews are worse and he can even remove them (after several warnings) if the clients are constantly submitting negative reviews. Also, the admin can change the password for this "branch" of the app. To be mentioned is the fact that if one person tries to enter the admin password and in case it is introduced 3 times incorrectly, the user will be redirected to the main page. <br/><br/>

The company registration option is dedicated to the companies. Each location has its manager and list of cars. Clients are able to rent a car from a location and drop it to another location should he wish to. <br/>
>After selecting the first option, the user should introduce the firm name, country, city, the number of the cars, phone number etc. Afterwards, the user should introduce the specifications for each car, from make, color to number of seats, doors and payment details. 
<br/>
After completing all the steps, the firm will be registered and available in the firms list for clients. <br/><br/>

The client side includes gathering of personal data (firstname, lastname, driving license details etc. ) - because the client must have an account and must be logged in in order to rent or drop cars. Furthermore, the client has to introduce the location from where he wants to rent the car and where he wants to drop it. Following this process, an immediate response will be given regarding the availability of the car and the steps to be followed in the case of non-availability of the car. <br/>
>During the rental process, the user should select one of the companies and the car he would like to rent. <br/>
Another option is making use of the current rented cars. Thus, the client may take a look around the rented cars at the moment. The customer may also drop a car or more.
